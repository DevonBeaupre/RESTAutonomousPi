# Header 1

Hello. This is the "RESTAutonomousPi" project where we take a PowerWheels car, reverse engineer it and make a small computer drive it, instead of a small child. Below are code snippets, Due Dates, and other resources we used and compiled so future teams of REST and others could use an autonomous vehicle with a Raspberry Pi.
